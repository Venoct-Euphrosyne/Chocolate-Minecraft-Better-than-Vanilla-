# Chocolate-Minecraft-Better-than-Vanilla-
My first personal/main add-on project for Minecraft Bedrock

Be sure to read both .docx in the addon folder before installing.
Credits: Alien edds for the wall template. Iron furnaces used as a furnace template.

1.0.2 Changelog:

Requires the Upcoming creator features experiement toggle (only for the ice walls and stairs to cull correctly)

I recommend playing with your content log turned off (the stairs will spam errors if you walk too far away from where they're placed and Im not sure how to fix it at this moment)

Updated the chocolate recipe (identifier was mispelt)

Fixed the Nether Guardian animation for 1.21.82 update

Adds the butterfly net, when used on a butterfly allows you to pick it up (In its current variant as well), so you have the ability to place it in an item frame, or place inside your own house! After a while the butterfly net can break, which you can repair with 1 string and 1 stick: "#XC" # = string, C = stick. The net itself can be crafted with 1 string in the bottom left corner, and the other 8 slots all string. 

Known bugs:

 - the butterfly items have an eating sound when used to place back down.

 - the butterfly will not spawn back in the same size variant as it was picked up in (Not fixable as its possible to document its scale data in the item)

Adds fireflies! They spawn naturally in swamps (at night), and can be eaten by the frogs. Spawns in 8 color variants, which you can use dye to change their color as follows:

red dye = red, orange dye = orange, yellow dye = yellow, lime dye = green, light blue dye = cyan, blue dye = blue, purple dye = purple, pink dye = pink. 

When a player kills a firefly, they can drop firefly juice, when used in a crafting table with soul sand/soil, and glass, allows you to craft the firefly jar, which can be placed in your house a decoration (it is animation so the firefly should fly around, I know the animation isnt the best I will improve it) when you punch the jar it should drop as the item you crafted. (The firefly also spawns in 2 different sizes)

Jar recipe (G is glass, J is your juice color, S is soul sand or soil):

GJG

GSG

Known bugs:

No data

Adds new stairs! 

Adds stair types of the new bricks, polished andesite brick stairs, polished granite brick stairs, and polished diorite brick stairs. Crafted like you would a traditional MC stair.

Adds the ice stairs as well of all types, crafted the same way, which can currently ONLY BE MINED WITH A SILK TOUCH PICK, NO OTHER TOOLS. I will fix this 

Known bugs:

- the normal ice stairs have missing texture faces sometimes

- the normal ice stairs have a weird breaking overlay. (Not fixable because its a stair, and I had to make the UV not overlay traditionally)

New bugs from pre-existing features I've found:

- the block furnace has a weird breaking overlay.

I also added my own easter egg. first person to find it and send a screenshot to me in my discord server gets to add their own:
